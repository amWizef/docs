# Introduction
 

ChatGPT API is an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like responses to text-based inputs. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture and has been trained on a massive amount of text data to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

To use the ChatGPT API, you will need to sign up for an API key from OpenAI. Once you have your API key, you can use it to make requests to the API and receive responses in JSON format.
